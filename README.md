# British Airways Data Science Programme

This repository contains my work for the British Airways Data Science Programme, a virtual experience program hosted on [The Forage website](https://www.theforage.com/). The program offers tasks to hone data science skills, focusing on web scraping and predictive modeling.

## Tasks
1. **Task 1:** Web scraping reviews from a website, data cleaning, and presentation.
2. **Task 2:** Building a model to predict customer buying behavior.

## Project Overview
This project is a personal initiative aimed at skill improvement. It involves gathering data from the Skytrax website to analyze British Airways reviews. The idea originated during my participation in a work experience program on the Forage website. The rich data inspired me to create a dashboard. Initially, I was assigned to summarize insights in a PowerPoint slide, but I expanded the scope to develop a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau.

## Key Features
- Utilized web scraping techniques to gather data.
- Cleaned and analyzed data to derive insights.
- Created a dashboard using Tableau for data visualization.

## Benefits
- Enhanced Tableau skills through practical application.
- Encouraged creativity and innovation in data presentation.
- Transformed raw data into actionable insights.

## Conclusion
This project not only fulfilled the program tasks but also served as a platform for personal growth and skill development. It showcases my ability to tackle real-world data challenges and present findings effectively.
